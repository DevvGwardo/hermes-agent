## What does this change?

<!-- The problem and why this approach. -->

## Could this live outside core?

<!-- Every core line is a conflict on each upstream sync. Why isn't this a plugin (plugins/, /api/plugins/<name>) or a managed-scope setting written by hermes-deploy? -->

### Code

- [ ] I've read the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] My commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`fix(scope):`, `feat(scope):`, etc.)
- [ ] I searched for [existing PRs](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/pulls) to make sure this isn't a duplicate
- [ ] My PR contains **only** changes related to this fix/feature (no unrelated commits)
- [ ] I've run `pytest tests/ -q` and all tests pass
- [ ] `python scripts/check` passes (the blocking lint and code-health checks CI runs)
- [ ] I've added tests for my changes (required for bug fixes, strongly encouraged for features)
- [ ] I've tested on my platform: <!-- e.g. Ubuntu 24.04, macOS 15.2, Windows 11 -->

### Documentation & Housekeeping

<!-- Check all that apply. It's OK to check "N/A" if a category doesn't apply to your change. -->

## For New Skills

<!-- Only fill this out if you're adding a skill. Delete this section otherwise. -->

- [ ] This skill is **broadly useful** to most users (if bundled) — see [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#should-the-skill-be-bundled)
- [ ] SKILL.md follows the [standard format](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#skillmd-format) (frontmatter, trigger conditions, steps, pitfalls)
- [ ] No external dependencies that aren't already available (prefer stdlib, curl, existing Hermes tools)
- [ ] I've tested the skill end-to-end: `hermes --toolsets skills -q "Use the X skill to do Y"`

## Screenshots / Logs

<!-- If applicable, add screenshots or log output showing the fix/feature in action. -->

## Production safety

<!-- Maia VM fork only (see FORK.md). -->

- [ ] Base is `maiavm` (not `main`, not upstream)
- [ ] Backwards compatible for existing clients (web dashboard, apps/desktop, Nub Agent app) — or the break is called out above
- [ ] New config keys are in `hermes_cli/config_defaults.py` and `cli-config.yaml.example`
- [ ] Tests added/updated; relevant modules pass (`scripts/run_tests.sh <paths>`)
- [ ] No secrets logged or echoed in responses/events
- [ ] FORK.md "Current core patches" updated if this adds a core patch
- [ ] Rolls out via a new `maiavm-*` tag + canary VM before the hermes-deploy pin moves
